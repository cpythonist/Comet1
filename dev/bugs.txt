1. -- DONE --
   Escaping characters does not work when piping commands.
   See http://cpythonist.github.io/clash/clash1/issues.html for more
   information.
2. -- DONE --
   While writing using the config command, e.g. "config -s path C:\", "C:\"
   is written to the config file. Escape the string then write it to the file.
3. -- DONE --
   `help` without arguments displays the text of copyright command
   offset to the right by 1 space.

1. -- DONE --
   `file \ | exec` gives unexpected output.
   Supposed to pass the output of the file command (for directory C:\) to the
   exec command.
   `file C:\ | exec` too.
   Think it's due to the character escape functionality that was just added.
   Chk it.

2. -- DONE --
   `title "'.', f\"{''.join(args.file.split('.')[:-1])}.exe\""`
   leads to an extra double-quote at the end of the title. Most probably arose
   from the escape functionality that was just added.
   `title "'.', f\"{''.join(args.file.split('.')[:-1])}.exe\"` gives the
   expected output for the previous command.

3. -- DONE --
   Change behaviour of ^ and ; such that the next command in line is executed
   even if an error like bad command or is a file error occurs.
   E.g. `./sdfsdggf ^ dir` should display the output of `dir` on STDOUT.

4. -- DONE --
   cd to ~/AppData/Local/Steam/htmlcache/, then there will be an empty file in
   the directory called "000003.log". Run the disp command on the file to
   display it, but instead encounters a fatal error (due to StopIteration).

5. -- CHANGE IN FINAL BUILD --
   Make sure to compress all the help strings before final release.

6. -- DONE --
   WEIRD BEHAVIOUR
   `find \/ /\n\n\n\nthiru/\valluvan` - Not supposed to print a newline, since
   there are no matches
   `find \ /\n\n\n\nthiru/\valluvan` - Doesn't match the backslash
   `find \\ /\n\n\n\nthiru/\valluvan` - Doesn't match the backslash
   `find \\ /\n\n\n\nthiru/\\valluvan` - Doesn't match the backslash
   `find \ thiru/\\valluvan` - Doesn't match the backslash

7. -- DONE --
   INTERPRETER CRASHES ON EXECUTION OF `find \ thiru/\\valluvan`
   Tried to fix by a repr(...) call for the pattern. But that makes other
   patterns to be not recognised by the re module.

8. ANSI codes get in the output when an operator is next in line when running
   aliases. Problem is the interpreter not keeping track of the operator parsed
   when parsing the alias. Tried to pass the operator to Intrp.execute(...),
   didn't work. Might actually work with a bit of effort. But I'm not in a
   position to fix it right now. I'm tired.

9. -- CHANGE IN FINAL BUILD --
   Thing is, you idiot, since you used commons.LOWERLT() for option checking
   and evaluation, the options are displayed in lower case when reporting
   unknown options. You goddamn fool. The great programmer who did that (me) is
   not going to touch that. Not right now. I don't plan on torturing myself, as
   that things has been like re-written like three to four times already over
   the course of six months, as of 01.05.2025.

10. ls command - outputs a newline when running `ls` on the current directory
    if the directory is empty.

11. When running the prog on wt.exe, commons.ANSIOK() returns False, even
    though the terminal does support ANSI codes.

12. -- DONE --
    Check `echo.\new > del -r`. It's not supposed to execute the del command, 
    as the first command fails.

13. Make sure to edit and refactor the help command and helper functions!
